Unique Number I
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 71.38%Submissions: 7K+Points: 2
Given a unsorted array arr[] of positive integers having all the numbers occurring exactly twice, except for one number which will occur only once. Find the number occurring only once.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 5, 5]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 2 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 2 is the answer.
Input: arr[] = [2, 30, 2, 15, 20, 30, 15]
Output: 20
Explanation: Since 20 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 20 is the answer.
Constraints
1 ≤  arr.size()  ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

Solution : 


class Solution {
    public int findUnique(int[] arr) {
        // code here
     HashMap<Integer , Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
     
     for(int num : arr){
         map.put(num , map.getOrDefault(num , 0)+1);
     }
     for(int num : map.keySet()){
         if(map.get(num) == 1){
             return num;
         }
     }
     return -1;
    }
}
