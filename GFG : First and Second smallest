Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 24.44%Submissions: 123K+Points: 1
Given an array, arr of integers, your task is to return the smallest and second smallest element in the array. If the smallest and second smallest do not exist, return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 3, 5, 6]
Output: 2 3 
Explanation: 2 and 3 are respectively the smallest and second smallest elements in the array.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]
Output: -1
Explanation: Only element is 1 which is smallest, so there is no second smallest element.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105

class Solution {
    public int[] minAnd2ndMin(int arr[]) {
        // code hereint count = 
           // Initialize first and second to large values
        int first = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int second = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Traverse the array
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num < first) {
                second = first;  // Update second to the previous first
                first = num;     // Update first to the new smallest element
            } else if (num < second && num != first) {
                second = num;    // Update second if num is smaller than second and not equal to first
            }
        }
        
        // If second is still not updated, return -1
        if (second == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            return new int[]{-1};
        }
        
        return new int[]{first, second}; // Return the smallest and second smallest
    }
}
