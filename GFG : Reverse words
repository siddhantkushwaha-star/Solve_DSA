Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 56.08%Submissions: 375K+Points: 2Average Time: 20m
Given a string s, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by spaces.

Note: The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, and no extra spaces should be included.

Examples :

Input: s = " i like this program very much "
Output: "much very program this like i"
Explanation: After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string (not individual words), the input string becomes "much very program this like i". 
Input: s = " pqr mno "
Output: "mno pqr"
Explanation: After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string, the input string becomes "mno pqr". 
Input: s = " a "
Output: "a"
Explanation: The input string contains only one word with extra spaces around it. After removing the extra spaces, the output is "a".Constraints:
Constraints:
1 <= s.size() <= 106
String s contains only lowercase English alphabets and spaces.


Solution : 


class Solution {
    // Function to reverse words in a given string
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Code here
         String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");

        // Use StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        // Append words in reverse order
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result.append(words[i]).append(" ");
        }

        // Remove the extra trailing space and return the result
        return result.toString().trim();
    }
}
