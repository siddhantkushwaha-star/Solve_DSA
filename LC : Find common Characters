Given a string array words, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the words (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.


class Solution {
    public List<String> commonChars(String[] words) {
          // Initialize the result list
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Create an array to store the frequency of characters in the first word
        int[] minFreq = new int[26]; // For storing frequencies of 'a' to 'z'
        
        // Initialize minFreq with the frequency of characters in the first word
        Arrays.fill(minFreq, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        
        for (String word : words) {
            // Create a frequency array for the current word
            int[] currentFreq = new int[26];
            
            // Count the frequency of characters in the current word
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                currentFreq[c - 'a']++;
            }
            
            // Update the minFreq array to store the minimum frequency of each character across all words
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                minFreq[i] = Math.min(minFreq[i], currentFreq[i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Add characters to the result based on their minimum frequency
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            // For each character, add it to the result as many times as it appears in all words
            for (int j = 0; j < minFreq[i]; j++) {
                result.add(String.valueOf((char) (i + 'a')));
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
