Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 51.21%Submissions: 377K+Points: 2
You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :

Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
Input: s = "a"
Output: true
Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.
Input: s = "acbca"
Output: true
Explanation: "acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 106

class Solution {
    boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        // code here
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length()-1;
        while(left < right){
            if(s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)){
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
